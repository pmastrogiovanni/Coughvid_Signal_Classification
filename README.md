# Cough Audio Signal Classification

Cough audio signal classification has been successfully used to diagnose a variety of respiratory conditions, and there has been significant interest in leveraging Machine Learning (ML) to provide widespread COVID-19 screening.

This dataset, also known as CoughVid, provides over 25,000 crowdsourced cough recordings representing a wide range of participant ages, genders, geographic locations, and COVID-19 statuses.

A subset of 2,800 recordings were labelled by four experienced physicians in order to diagnose medical abnormalities present in the coughs, thereby contributing one of the largest expert-labeled cough datasets in the current literature that can be used for a plethora of cough audio classification tasks.
